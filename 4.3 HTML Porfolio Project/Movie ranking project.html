                WALL-E (2008) (Sci-Fi)

                    Finding Nemo's Andrew Stanton went from deep sea to deep space for this delightfully warped trek, seen through the eyes of a trash-bot tasked with cleaning up a centuries-later Earth smothered in garbage.

                    Laced with satirical social commentary regarding the consequences of excess and pollution, WALL-E is a love story among the landfills and one of the best Pixar movies to date. It's an imaginative romp through the fattened ashes of humanity featuring a mostly-silent, slapstick-prone protagonist finding romance amidst enthralling visuals and an emotionally-charged apocalypse. Evoking the distinguished charm of old silent movies, while still featuring occasional dialogue, WALL-E clings to optimism in the wake of waste.

                    <p>Chris Columbus launched the “Harry Potter” movie franchise with bloated fantasy spectacles that delivered eye-popping VFX thrills and squeaky clean, family-friendly storytelling. It wasn’t until Alfonso Cuarón stepped in to helm the third installment, “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” that cinephiles started taking “Harry Potter” seriously. In Cuarón’s hands, the franchise realized its full potential as a studio blockbuster that could match its fantasy dazzle with mature emotional undertones.

                    The filmmaker allowed the franchise to grow up with its teenage characters and injected a darker tone into the series that made “Prisoner of Azkaban” the first “Harry Potter” film to have genuinely dangerous stakes for Harry, Ron, Hermione, and more. The visual palette alone was a stark contrast to what came before, as cinematographer Michael Seresin cast a cold, grey shadow over the look of the film to give it more of a hardened edge. In forcing the characters and the franchise itself to grow up, Cuarón delivered the best “Harry Potter” movie ever. —ZS
